h1. Regexme-this

Regexme-this is a web based regular expression testing service, there are plenty out there but not many of them allow you to test different languages in one location - so I made it so.

h2. Using it online

Regexme-this is available online "here":http://regexme-this.27smiles.com but you may also run it offline locally, see below.

h3. Run locally

You need to have Ruby and if you want to test Python, then python too. Python is called via the command line so it needs to be callable.

First install the required dependencies.
<pre><code>gem install sinatra haml json</code></pre>

Then clone the repository.
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/RichGuk/regexme-this.git</code></pre>

Finally you can get it running!
<pre><code>ruby application.rb</code></pre>

Then in your browser go to.
<pre><code>http://localhost:4567</code></pre>

Done!
